# nfc_acr122u
Cross-platform C code for ACR122U NFC reader. Also contains code to generate NDEF Short Records (Text).

## Supported Tags
* Mifare Classic 1K / 4k
* Mifare Ultralight EV 1

## Future Work
I got a new reader (ACR1581U) and have made a [separate repo](https://github.com/felix314159/nfc_acr1581u) for it. In that repo I will aim support the following tags:
* Mifare DESFire EV3 8K
* NTAG 424 DNA TT
* NTAG 413 DNA
* ICODE SLIX
* EM4423 / EM4425
